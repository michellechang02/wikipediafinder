Wikipedia Path Finder helps you discover the shortest path between two Wikipedia articles using Breadth-First Search (BFS). Enter any two article topics and see how they're connected through Wikipedia links!

- ⚡ **Fast:** Limited to 1000 nodes for quick results.
- 🔗 **Simple:** Just enter your start and end topics (case sensitive, include spaces).
- 🌐 **Accessible:** Works online and locally (see below).

> **Tip:** For best results, avoid extremely distant article pairs (very long paths).
